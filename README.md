love-puzzle-bobble
==================

Clone of Puzzle Bobble in [LÃ–VE](http://www.love2d.org "It's free!"), idk why.


WORKING
-------
- Gameplay (you can shoot bubbles and they will drop when you match three)
- Level (random) generation
- Basic levels structure (get harder the more you win)
- Basic support of [love-webplayer](https://github.com/ghoulsblade/love-webplayer)


TODO
----
- General beautifying
- Figure out license and stuff (you can use everything I did however you like, the music isn't mine)

(i.e. "the boring part")
